# Quantitative synthesis: a practical guide on meta-analysis, meta-regression, and publication bias tests for environmental sciences


## Preface

This is a step-by-step tutorial, which is a supplement to our methodological guideline paper published in [Environmental Evidence](https://environmentalevidencejournal.biomedcentral.com/) (the official journal of the [Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE)](https://environmentalevidence.org/)).

This tutorial has 5 features.

- It suits many types of readers who have interests and want to learn meta-analytic techniques, from beginners to senior researchers who might already conducted lots of meta-analyses in environmental sciences.

- It can help meta-analysts in many disciplines, albeit the main targets are environmental researchers and we put all technical details in the context of the environmental sciences.

- The illustrative implementation of each method is along with the details in the math, statistical theory, and explanations (more details see main text); in this way, readers can can transfer these methods to the statistical software (e.g., `Python`, `Stata`) with which they are familiar (yes - not necessarily `R`).

- All scripts are well annotated and corresponding outputs are well interpreted.

- We will update this tutorial when necessary. Reader can access the latest version in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/itchyshin/Meta-analysis_tutorial) 

## Credit

We acknowledge that this online tutorial has borrowed some ideas and code from published papers in Prof. Shinichi Nakagawa's lab ([see full publication list](http://www.i-deel.org/publications.html)) and from  (Associate) Prof. Wolfgang Viechtbauer's versatile `R` package `metafor` ([see the documentation](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/), [GitHub page](https://github.com/cran/metafor), and [package webpage](https://www.metafor-project.org/)). 

We thanks the the two groups for their good lab culture of Open Science and their advocate of Open Science practices. We also call for more Open Science practices in the environmental sciences, for example, data sharing, code sharing, transparent reporting and open archiving, to make the field more **open**, **reliable**, and **transparent**.
