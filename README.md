# Meta-analysis_tutorial for environmental science
online tutorial for implementing mulitlevel meta-analysis (Environmental Evidence) 

# Credit
We acknowledge that this online tutorial has borrowed some ideas and code from published papers in Prof. Shinichi Nakagawa's lab ([see full publication list](http://www.i-deel.org/publications.html)) and from  (Associate) Prof. Wolfgang Viechtbauer's versatile `R` package `metafor` ([see the documentation](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/), [GitHub page](https://github.com/cran/metafor), and [package webpage](https://www.metafor-project.org/)). 

We thanks the the two groups for their good lab culture of Open Science and their advocate of Open Science practices. We also call for more Open Science practices in the environmental sciences, for example, data sharing, code sharing, transparent reporting and open archiving, to make the field more **open**, **reliable**, and **transparent**.
