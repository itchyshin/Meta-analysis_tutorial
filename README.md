# Quantitative synthesis: a practical guide on meta-analysis, meta-regression, and publication bias tests for environmental sciences

## Tutorial

[Access to Tutorial](https://itchyshin.github.io/Meta-analysis_tutorial/)

## Preface

This is a step-by-step tutorial, which is a supplement to our methodological guideline paper written for [Environmental Evidence](https://environmentalevidencejournal.biomedcentral.com/) (the official journal of the [Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE)](https://environmentalevidence.org/)).

### Intended audience:

- Our target audience is broad, and includes beginners and students to senior researchers who might have already conducted meta-analyses in environmental sciences.

- While the material covered is mostly relevant to researchers from environmental sciences, the tutorial should be accessible to meta-analysts from other disciplines.

- In addition to detailed instructions and well-annoted scripts for implementing and interpreting the analyses using the R software environment, we also provide details of the underlying math and statistical theory to enable readers to implement these methods using other statistical software (e.g., `Python`, `Stata`). 

- The tutorial will be updated when necessary. Readers can access the latest version in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/itchyshin/Meta-analysis_tutorial) .

## Credit

This online tutorial has borrowed ideas and code from published papers in Prof. Shinichi Nakagawa's lab ([see full publication list](http://www.i-deel.org/publications.html)) and from  (Associate) Prof. Wolfgang Viechtbauer's versatile `R` package `metafor` ([see the documentation](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/), [GitHub page](https://github.com/cran/metafor), and [package webpage](https://www.metafor-project.org/)). 

We thank the these two research groups for their advocacy of Open Science practices. We encourage the researchers from all fields to embrace **open**, **reliable**, and **transparent** practices, such as thorugh sharing data and code, transparent reporting and archiving.
